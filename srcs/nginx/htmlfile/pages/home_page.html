                    <p>Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games and a classic of the medium. It simulates table
                        tennis, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. Players control paddles to hit a ball back
                        and forth across the screen.</p>
                    <p>The game's simplicity and intuitive gameplay made it a hit and helped establish the video game
                        industry. Pong's influence can still be seen in many modern games, including our own TRONPONG!
